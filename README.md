# 👋 Hi, I'm @Jessiebrig

From C# beginnings in 2019 to creating **PySeed** - a Python project template that handles the boring setup stuff.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

**PySeed** - Because setting up a Python project shouldn't be harder than coding it.
- 🌍 Cross-platform Python project management
- 🔄 Smart GitHub integration with auto-updates  
- 🏗️ Menu-driven executable building
- 🎮 No command-line wizardry required

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python** - Current focus with PySeed ecosystem
- **C#** - Where it all started back in 2019
- **Selenium** - Web automation and testing
- **Django** - Web framework

## 🌱 Currently Working On
- Expanding PySeed's cross-platform support
- Building tools that bridge the gap between hobby coding and professional distribution
- Making Python project setup painless for developers who code for fun
- Learning Flutter for mobile development

## 🤝 Let's Connect
